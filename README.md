<p>
RoboCon is a free and accessible robotics competition aimed at GCSE students run by Hills Road Sixth Form College.  

We provide a kit containing all the equipment necessary to build a simple robot, including a laptop that you can use to program it. Teams are encouraged to use this kit as inspiration to create a robot as simple or complex as they would like. 

No previous experience is required, and we provide support throughout the year through our kick-off event and various tech days.

<h2>Robocon 2022 will be held on the 13th and 14th April</h2>
