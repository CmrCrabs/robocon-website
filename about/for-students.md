# For Students

**RoboCon** is an exciting autonomous robotics competition which you can enter for free. You and your team will be loaned a kit containing everything that you need to design, build and program your robot.

The objective of the competition is announced in the Autumn term and you have until the Easter Holidays to perfect your design. Throughout this time we will support you with drop-in sessions on Saturdays, tech days where you can practice in the real arena and online support through the forum on this website.

This is a opportunity to put theory into practice, learn about the real world and most importantly have fun playing with real robots!

*Don't Walk.* **Do The Robot!**
