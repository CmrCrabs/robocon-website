# For Students

**RoboCon 2022** is an exciting autonomous robotics competition which you can enter for free. You and your team will be loaned a kit containing everything that you need to design, build and program your robot.

The objective of the competition will be announced in the Autumn term of 2021 and you will have till the Easter Holidays to perfect your design. Throughout this time we will support you with drop in sessions on Saturdays, techdays where you can practice in the real arena and online support through the forum on this website. 

This is a opportunity to put theory into practice, learn about the real world and most importantly have fun playing with real robots!
