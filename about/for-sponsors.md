# Why STEM?

> Scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. To succeed in this new information-based and highly technological society, students need to develop their capabilities in STEM

# Why extracircular?

Since 2016 GCSE's have become more accedemic, depriving students of any opotinuity to learn how to put theory in to practice. Therefore there is a need to promote STEM actively outside of lessons to ensure that students feel willing and able to choose STEM based A-levels. This ensures students are not blocked from STEM career paths further down the line.

# Why RoboCon?

RoboCon aims to fill a gap left by many STEM outreach activities. It provides a long term project where the students can explore the engineering process of design, test and improvement. It aims to provide a task where there is no "correct" solution and students can put their ideas into practice.
