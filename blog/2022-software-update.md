Hi teams!

We've been working over the past half term to get out a patch in order to fix a few issues with the BrainBox, including some problems with input/output pins that some teams pointed out to us at the launch in October. It also means that anyone who wishes to can now use our Blockly coding option to program their robot, as the issues with robot vision that occurred when using it previously have also been fixed.

Please do make sure you update your robot to have this most recent patch, which you can find [here](/public/2022-patch-v1.zip).
