Not long until the competition now and we can't wait to see you all! 



We've had a couple of requests for details about the competition final from teams, so we wanted to make sure that you know everything you need to before arriving.



The competition will be running on the **13th and 14th of April, 10am-4pm**. It will be held at Hills Road Sixth Form College. Directions to the competition area are [here](/GettingToRoboCon2022.pdf), and there will be signs around the college site. There is parking in the college carpark on Purbeck Road, open to all teams over the course of the competition. 



The onsite café will be open to sell food and drink and they would like to know what kind of food you are likely to want from it, if any. Please fill out this form: <https://forms.office.com/r/Yh33Pe60d5> and get your team members to do so as well. 



We also wanted to remind you all about the prizes that are on offer, and how you can win one without needing to be the team that scores the most points. 



In addition to the prizes for first, second and third place, we will be offering:

* The Lion Award: for courage and perseverance
* The Scarecrow Award: for extraordinary ingenuity
* The Tin Man Award: for team spirit and theme

Over the course of the competition final, we will have representatives from our sponsors who will be judging these awards. They may also offer prizes for other team characteristics they deem to be remarkable and award-worthy.



Finally, and crucially, **you must fill out a media consent form to attend the competition final**. You can find the form [here](/RoboConMediaConsentReleaseForm.pdf), and all attendees must complete it. Students under the age of 16 will need this to be done by their parents/guardians.
