Today was the official launch of RoboCon 2022: Gifts for the Wizard. It was a great success, with eight schools attending and spending the day working with their kit.

The day began with an introduction to this year's competition, which is themed around the Wizard of Oz and challenges teams to deliver gifts to the Wizard in the Emerald City. Teams will score points based on where their gifts are located at the end of a round, with each region of the map scoring a different number of points.
