RoboCon 2022 launched in October 2021 with the game "Gifts for the Wizard", a *Wizard of Oz* themed game in which the ultimate goal was for a team's robot to move their five gifts (cubes) from their country (zone) into the Emerald City in which the Wizard resides (the centre of the arena). The blog post from the launch event can be found [here](robocon-2022-launched.html).
